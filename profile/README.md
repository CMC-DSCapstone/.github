# Capstone Support at the QCL  
**Murty Sunak Quantitative and Computing Lab**  
Claremont McKenna College

## Overview

The Murty Sunak Quantitative and Computing Lab (QCL) provides specialized support for senior thesis and capstone projects across all disciplines. Our goal is to help students incorporate quantitative reasoning, data analysis, and computational tools into their academic research.

Whether you are analyzing economic data, running regressions in R, creating visualizations in Python, or exploring text data in the humanities, the QCL offers the guidance and resources to support your work from start to finish.
